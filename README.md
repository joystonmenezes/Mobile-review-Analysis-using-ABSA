# Mobile-review-Analysis-using-ABSA
This code will implement the Aspect based sentiment  analysis task in python on a mobile reviews dataset. 

# Overview
The ABSA model could be decomposed in three distinct main processes for an out-of-domain usecase:

Learning the Aspect Categories (SCREEN$Quality, PROCESSOR$Performance, etc.)
Finding the aspect words in sentences (retina screen, butterfly keyboard etc.) and classify to aspect category
Computing the polarity for each aspect in each entry
However, our mobile usecase is what we call in-domain. That is, we already have defined the aspect categories related to the reviews. We then have a model composed of two distinct models: the Aspect Categories classifier and the Sentiment Model.
