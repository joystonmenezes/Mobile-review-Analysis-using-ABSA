Review
very bad . battery heats up very fast
camera is very good
I tried many battery but this battery is just awsome ....please go through it...and buy ...thank u seller for understanding the need...
"Very poor quality, did not charge properly and discharge in a few second"
Product is genuine and effective. Original battery of Jio Fi
The battery is completely useless to me
Innovative product. I am able to charge my spare battery of mobile. It senses + and - polarities automatically.
"it's good,the battery backup is very good having 6 month warranty.."
Built quality is poor. Front camera is worst. Back camera doesn't look like 48megapixel. The product which I received has a back panel issue. Don't buy pearl white.
New Battery works great in phone
"Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life"
"Battery life is good; however, when watching media the powerful screen results in heavy drain of the battery."
"I am really happy with battery backup as it lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with medium usage including WiFi and GPS."
This is good mobile battery 2 day working
The only thing I didn't like was the camera its horrible when trying to get a take picture the pictures wasn't clear
"The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots."
zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have.
